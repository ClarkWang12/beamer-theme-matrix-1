# Another Beamer Theme Matrix

As you probably know, [Beamer](http://bitbucket.org/rivanvx/beamer/) is a LaTeX
package for creating presentation slides. This matrix shows examples of all
variations of the default themes and color themes. The matrix's rows list the
default Beamer themes, and the matrix's columns list the default Beamer color
themes.

## Building Theme Matrix

To build the theme matrix, run `generate.py`. It has been tested on both Python
2.7 and Python 3.4 under Linux Mint 17. Besides Python, `pdflatex`, `pdftoppm`,
`convert`, `pngquant`, and `optipng` are needed on the path.
